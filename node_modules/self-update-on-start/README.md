# Self Update on Start
This module updates it's parent and all of it's parent's modules on start up.  It spawns `git pull` using the repository url found in package.json to and then spawns `npm i --save`.
## Usage
Don't store copies of other npm repositories in your project's repository, use npm the way it was meant to be used!  Use `node_modules/**` in your .gitignore file.  Then make sure to run self-update-on-start at the very start of your program before requiring any dependencies.  Put your project's main contents in another file so you never have to update `index.js` and don't have to restart for changes to take effect!
### Example index.js
```javascript
const selfUpdate = require('self-update-on-start');

selfUpdate((code) => {
	require('./src/main.js')();
});
```
