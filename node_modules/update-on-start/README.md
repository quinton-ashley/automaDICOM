# Node Update on Start
This module updates it's parent and all of it's parent's modules on start up.  It spawns `git pull` using the repository url found in package.json to and then spawns `npm update --save`.
## Usage
Don't store copies of npm repositories in your project's repository, use npm the way it was meant to be used!  Make sure to run `update-on-start` at the very start of your program before requiring any dependencies.  Put your project's main contents in another file so you never have to update `index.js` and don't have to restart for changes to take effect!  In your repository's `.gitignore` file, exclude all of your node_modules and use `!` to make an exception for `update-on-start`.
### Example index.js
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

// true if the program is run independently as a CLI
if (require.main == module) {
	const selfUpdate = require('update-on-start');

	selfUpdate(() => {
		require('./src/main.js')();
	});
} else {
	module.exports = require('./src/main.js');
}
```
### Example .gitignore
```
/node_modules/**
!/node_modules/update-on-start/**
```
